scalyr-tool
===========

Command-line tool for accessing Scalyr services. The following commands are currently supported:

- [**query**](#querying-logs): Retrieve log data
- [**power-query**](#power-queries): Execute PowerQuery
- [**numeric-query**](#fetching-numeric-data): Retrieve numeric / graph data
- [**facet-query**](#fetching-facet-counts): Retrieve common values for a field
- [**timeseries-query**](#fetching-numeric-data-using-a-timeseries): Retrieve numeric / graph data from a timeseries
- [**get-file**](#retrieving-configuration-files): Fetch a configuration file
- [**put-file**](#creating-or-updating-configuration-files): Create or update a configuration file
- [**delete-file**](#creating-or-updating-configuration-files): Delete a configuration file
- [**list-files**](#listing-configuration-files): List all configuration files
- [**tail**](#tailing-logs): Provide a live 'tail' of a log


## Installation

Simply download the script file and make it executable. For instance:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalyr/scalyr-tool/master/scalyr > scalyr
    chmod u+x scalyr
    mv scalyr (some directory on your command path)

You also need to make your Scalyr API tokens available to the tool. You can specify the token
on the command line using the `--token` argument. However, it is more convenient to store your
tokens in environment variables. This also keeps the tokens out of your console window and
command history. On Unix systems, you can add the following to a file like `.bash_profile`:

    export scalyr_readlog_token='XXX'
    export scalyr_readconfig_token='YYY'
    export scalyr_writeconfig_token='ZZZ'

The values for XXX, YYY, and ZZZ can be found at [scalyr.com/keys](https://www.scalyr.com/keys) -- look
for "Read Logs", "Read Config", and "Write Config" tokens, respectively.

Setting a custom Scalyr server can be done using the `--server` argument but also via environment variable:

    export scalyr_server='https://eu.scalyr.com'

After adding these to `.bash_profile`, make sure to also paste them into your current console session,
so that they take effect immediately. Alternatively, run `source ~/.bash_profile`.

## Querying logs

The "query" command allows you to search and filter your logs, or simply retrieve raw log data. The
capabilities are similar to the regular [log view](https://www.scalyr.com/events?mode=log), though you
can retrieve more data at once and have several output format options.

Here are some usage examples:

    # Display the last 10 log records
    scalyr query

    # Display the last 100 log records, showing only timestamp, severity, and message.
    # (Timestamp and severity are always displayed.)
    scalyr query --count=100 --columns='timestamp,severity,message'

    # Display the first 10 log records beginning at 3:00 PM today, from host100.
    scalyr query '$serverHost="host100"' --start='3:00 PM'

    # Display the last 1000 entries in the log tagged as source=accessLog. Print only the status
    # and path, in CSV format.
    scalyr query '$source="accessLog"' --output=csv --columns='status,uriPath' --count=1000

Complete argument list:

    scalyr query [filter] [options...]
        The filter specifies which log records to return. It uses the same syntax as the "Expression"
        field in the [log view](https://www.scalyr.com/events?mode=log).

    --start=xxx
        Specify the beginning of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "Start" field in
        the log view. Defaults to 1 day ago, or to 1 day before the end time if an end time is given.
    --end=xxx
        Specify the end of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "End" field in the log
        view. Defaults to the current time, or to 1 day after the start time if a start time is given.
    --count=nnn
        How many log records to retrieve, from 1 to 5000. Defaults to 10.
    --mode=head|tail
        Whether to display log records from the start or end of the time range. Defaults to head if a
        start time is given, otherwise to tail.
    --columns="..."
        Which log attributes to display. Used mainly for logs for which you have specified a parser to
        extract attributes from the raw text. Specify one or more attribute names, separated by commas.
    --output=multiline|singleline|csv|json|json-pretty
        How to display the log records (see below).
    --version
        Prints the current version number of this tool.
    --priority=high|low
        Specifies the execution priority for this query; defaults to "high". Use "low" for scripted
        operations where a delay of a second or so is acceptable. Rate limits are tighter for high-
        priority queries.
    --token=xxx
        Specify the API token. For this command, should be a "Read Logs" token.
    --verbose
        Writes detailed progress information to stderr.
    --proxy=<ip>:<port>
        An address to connect through when using a proxy. If not set will also take the value from one of the following
        environment variables if any are set: http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY

#### Output formats

By default, the query command outputs log records in a fairly verbose format designed for manual
viewing. You can get something more like a classic log view by specifying a columns list, as shown in
one of the examples above.

The 'singleline' output option is similar to the default, but places all of a record's attributes on
a single line. This is denser, but can be harder to read.

The 'csv' output option emits one line per log record, in Excel comma-separated-value format (with
`CRLF` as the line separator, per the [spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180#page-2)). To use
this option, you must specify the `--columns` argument.

The 'json-pretty' output option also emits the JSON response from the server, but prettyprinted.

#### Usage limits

Your command line and API queries are limited to 30,000 milliseconds of server processing time,
replenished at 36,000 milliseconds per hour. If you exceed this limit, your queries will be intermittently
refused. (Your other uses of Scalyr, such as log uploading or queries via the web site, will not be impacted.)
If you need a higher limit, drop us a line at support@scalyr.com.

## Power Queries

The "power-query" command allows you to execute a PowerQuery. The
capabilities are similar to the regular [PowerQuery](https://www.scalyr.com/query), though you
can retrieve more data at once and have several output format options.

Here are some usage examples:

    # Display log volume summary by forlogfile for the last 24 hours
    scalyr power-query "tag='logVolume' metric='logBytes' | group sum(value) by forlogfile" --start="24h"

    # Display a table of requests, errors and error rate for the last 7 days, in pretty-printed JSON
    scalyr power-query "dataset = 'accesslog' | group requests = count(), errors = count(status == 404) \
    by uriPath | let rate = errors / requests | filter rate > 0.01 | sort -rate" --start="7d" --end="0d" \
    --output=json-pretty

Complete argument list:

    scalyr power-query [query] [options...]
        The query specifies the PowerQuery. It uses the same syntax as the "PowerQueries"
        page which is documented [here](https://app.scalyr.com/help/power-queries).

    --start=xxx
        Specify the beginning of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "Start" field in
        the PowerQueries page. This field is required.
    --end=xxx
        Specify the end of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "End" field in the PowerQueries page. 
        Defaults to 1 day after the start time if a start time is given.
    --output=csv|json|json-pretty
        How to display the log records (see below).
    --version
        Prints the current version number of this tool.
    --priority=high|low
        Specifies the execution priority for this query; defaults to "high". Use "low" for scripted
        operations where a delay of a second or so is acceptable. Rate limits are tighter for high-
        priority queries.
    --token=xxx
        Specify the API token. For this command, should be a "Read Logs" token.
    --verbose
        Writes detailed progress information to stderr.
    --proxy=<ip>:<port>
        An address to connect through when using a proxy. If not set will also take the value from one of the following
        environment variables if any are set: http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY

#### Output formats

By default, the power-query command outputs in 'csv' format, which emits one line per log record, in Excel 
comma-separated-value format (with `CRLF` as the line separator, per the [spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180#page-2)). 

The 'json' output option, not surprisingly, emits a JSON response.

The 'json-pretty' output option also emits the JSON response from the server, but prettyprinted.

#### Usage limits

Your command line and API queries are limited to 30,000 milliseconds of server processing time,
replenished at 36,000 milliseconds per hour. If you exceed this limit, your queries will be intermittently
refused. (Your other uses of Scalyr, such as log uploading or queries via the web site, will not be impacted.)
If you need a higher limit, drop us a line at support@scalyr.com.

## Tailing logs

The 'tail' command is similar to the '[query](#querying-logs)' command, except it runs continually, printing query results to stdout.

Here are some usage examples:

    # Display a live tail of all log records
    scalyr tail

    # Display a live tail of all log records from host100.
    scalyr tail '$serverHost="host100"'

    # Display a live tail of all log records containing the text [WARN]
    #   Note: the [] need to be quoted to be processed as text by Scalyr.
    #   You also need to quote/escape the quotes so they are not eaten by the shell
    scalyr tail '"[WARN]"'

    # Display a live tail of log messages, including attributes
    scalyr tail --output multiline

Complete argument list:

    scalyr tail [filter] [options...]
        The filter specifies which log records to return. It uses the same syntax as the "Expression"
        field in the [log view](https://www.scalyr.com/events?mode=log).

    --lines K,
    -n K
        Output the previous K lines when starting the tail.  Defaults to 10.

    --output multiline|singleline|messageonly
        Similar to the multiline and singleline options for the 'query' command, but also has a 'messageonly'
        mode that will only display the raw log message, and not any additional attributes.
        Defaults to 'messageonly'.

#### Usage limits

The 'tail' command is currently restricted to read a maximum of 1,000 log records per 10 seconds.  Additionally,
tails will automatically expire after 10 mins.  Please contact support@scalyr.com if you require an increase to
these limits.

#### Server clocks

If the clocks on the servers sending log messages to Scalyr are significantly out of sync then some messages may not appear in the live tail.  For example, if you send us a new log message with a timestamp old enough that it's not in the 1,000 most recent messages when it arrives at the Scalyr servers, then it will not be displayed by the live tail tool.

## Fetching numeric data

The "numeric-query" command allows you to retrieve numeric data, e.g. for graphing. You can count the
rate of events matching some criterion (e.g. error rate), or retrieve a numeric field (e.g. response
size). 

A numeric query is a special case of a [timeseries-query](#fetching-numeric-data-using-a-timeseries) with flags
`createSummaries = false`, `onlyUseSummaries = false`. If you will be invoking the same query repeatedly (e.g. in a script), 
you may want to use the timeseries query command with `createSummaries = true` (as is default) rather than 
`numeric-query`.

The commands take the same options and return the same data, but for `timeseries-query` invocations we create a
timeseries on the backend for each unique filter/function pair.  Timeseries queries execute near-instantaneously, and
avoid exhausting your query execution limit (see below).

Here are some usage examples:

    # Count the rate (per second) of occurrences of "/login" in all logs, in each of the last 24 hours
    scalyr numeric-query '"/login"' --start 24h --buckets 24

    # Display the average response size of all requests in the last hour
    scalyr numeric-query '$dataset="accesslog"' --function 'bytes' --start 1h

Complete argument list:

    scalyr numeric-query [filter] --start xxx [options...]
        The filter specifies which log records to process. It uses the same syntax as the "Expression"
        field in the [log view](https://www.scalyr.com/events?mode=log).

    --function=xxx
        The value to compute from the matching events. You can use any function listed in
        https://www.scalyr.com/help/query-language#graphFunctions, except for fraction(expr). For
        example: 'mean(x)' or 'median(responseTime)', if x and responseTime are fields of your log.
        You can also specify a simple field name, such as 'responseTime', to return the mean value of
        that field. If you omit the function argument, the rate of matching events per second will be
        returned. Specifying 'rate' yields the same result. Finally, you can specify "count", to compute
        the number of matching events in each time period (as defined by the "buckets" option).
    --start=xxx
        Specify the beginning of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "Start" field in
        the log view. You must specify this argument.
    --end=xxx
        Specify the end of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "End" field in the log
        view. Defaults to the current time.
    --buckets=nnn
        The number of numeric values to return. The time range is divided into this many equal slices.
        For instance, suppose you query a four-hour period, with buckets = 4. The query will return four
        numbers, each covering a one-hour period. You may specify a value from 1 to 5000; 1 is the default.
    --output=csv|json|json-pretty
        How to display the results. 'csv' prints all values on a single line, separated by commas.
        'json' prints the raw JSON response from the server, as documented at
        https://www.scalyr.com/help/api#numericQuery. 'json-pretty' also prints the JSON response,
        but prettyprinted.
    --priority=high|low
        Specifies the execution priority for this query; defaults to "high". Use "low" for scripted
        operations where a delay of a second or so is acceptable. Rate limits are tighter for high-
        priority queries.
    --token=xxx
        Specify the API token. For this command, should be a "Read Logs" token.
    --version
        Prints the current version number of this tool.
    --verbose
        Writes detailed progress information to stderr.
    --proxy=<ip>:<port>
        An address to connect through when using a proxy. If not set will also take the value from one of the following
        environment variables if any are set: http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY

## Fetching facet counts

The "facet-query' command allows you to retrieve the most common values for a field. For instance, you can
find the most common URLs accessed on your site, the most common user-agent strings, or the most common
response codes returned. (If a very large number of events match your search criteria, the results will be
based on a random subsample of at least 500,000 matching events.)

The default output format is CSV, sorted by count desc:

```
count,value
4,value-the-first
2,"other value"
```

_Note that CSV output uses `CRLF` as the line separator._


Here are some usage examples:

    curl 'https://www.scalyr.com/api/facetQuery?queryType=facet&field=uriPath&startTime=1h&token=XXX'

    # Display the most common HTTP request URLs in the last 24 hours.
    scalyr facet-query '$dataset="accesslog"' uriPath --start 24h

    # Display the most common HTTP response codes for requests to index.html.
    scalyr facet-query 'uriPath="/index.html"' status --start 24h

Complete argument list:

    scalyr facet-query filter field --start xxx [options...]
        The filter specifies which log records to process. It uses the same syntax as the "Expression"
        field in the [log view](https://www.scalyr.com/events?mode=log).

    --count=nnn
        How many distinct values to return. You may specify a value from 1 to 1000; 100 is the default.
    --start=xxx
        Specify the beginning of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "Start" field in
        the log view. You must specify this argument.
    --end=xxx
        Specify the end of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "End" field in the log
        view. Defaults to the current time.
    --output=csv|json|json-pretty
        How to display the results. 'csv' prints one value (and its count) per line, separated by commas.
        'json' prints the raw JSON response from the server, as documented at
        https://www.scalyr.com/help/api#numericQuery. 'json-pretty' also prints the JSON response,
        but prettyprinted.
    --priority=high|low
        Specifies the execution priority for this query; defaults to "high". Use "low" for scripted
        operations where a delay of a second or so is acceptable. Rate limits are tighter for high-
        priority queries.
    --token=xxx
        Specify the API token. For this command, should be a "Read Logs" token.
    --version
        Prints the current version number of this tool.
    --verbose
        Writes detailed progress information to stderr.
    --proxy=<ip>:<port>
        An address to connect through when using a proxy. If not set will also take the value from one of the following
        environment variables if any are set: http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY


#### Usage limits

Your command line and API queries are limited to 30,000 milliseconds of server processing time,
replenished at 36,000 milliseconds per hour. If you exceed this limit, your queries will be intermittently
refused. (Your other uses of Scalyr, such as log uploading or queries via the web site, will not be impacted.)
If you need a higher limit, drop us a line at support@scalyr.com.


## Fetching numeric data using a timeseries

A timeseries precomputes a numeric query, allowing you to execute queries almost instantaneously, and without
exhausting your query execution limit.  This is especially useful if you are using the Scalyr API to feed a
home-built dashboard, alerting system, or other automated tool. Note that the [Scalyr API](https://www.scalyr.com/help/api#timeseriesQuery)
allows multiple timeseries queries in a single API invocation, but the command-line tool only supports
one query at a time.

When a new timeseries is defined, we immediately start live updating of that timeseries from the ingestion pipeline.
In addition, we begin a background process to extend the timeseries backward in time, so that it covers the full
timespan of your query. This backfill process is automatic, and if you later issue the same query with an even
earlier start time, we will extend the backfill to cover that as well.
To change this behavior, set `createSummaries` to false.

A related flag, `onlyUseSummaries`, controls whether this API call should only use preexisting timeseries or should
actually execute the queries against the event database. If set to true, then your API call is guaranteed to return
quickly and to execute inexpensively, but with possibly-incomplete results. If set to false, the call  is slower
& more expensive, but will be complete.
Issuing a new query over the past 3 weeks with `createSummaries = true`, `onlyUseSummaries = true` will return quickly
no matter what, but will initially return incomplete results until backfill (covering the past 3 weeks) is complete.
This can be a cost-effective way to seed a new timeseries with a long backfill period when you don't need complete
results right away.

Issuing a timeseries command with `createSummaries = false`, `onlyUseSummaries = false` is equivalent to a [numeric-query](#Fetching numeric data) command.

Usage is identical to the numeric-query command:

    scalyr timeseries-query '$dataset="accesslog"' --function 'bytes' --start 24h --buckets 24

Complete argument list:

    scalyr timeseries-query [filter] [--function xxx] --start xxx [options...]
        Just like numeric-query, but with Scalyr creating a timeseries for you in the background, unless `createSummaries = false`

    scalyr timeseries-query --timeseries <timeseriesid> --start xxx [options...]
        To query a timeseries created using create-timeseries 

    --start=xxx
        Specify the beginning of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "Start" field in
        the log view. You must specify this argument.
    --end=xxx
        Specify the end of the time range to query. Uses the same syntax as the "End" field in the log
        view. Defaults to the current time.
    --function=xxx
        Only used if --timeseries is not provided.
        The value to compute from the matching events. You can use any function listed in
        https://www.scalyr.com/help/query-language#graphFunctions, except for fraction(expr). For
        example: 'mean(x)' or 'median(responseTime)', if x and responseTime are fields of your log.
        You can also specify a simple field name, such as 'responseTime', to return the mean value of
        that field. If you omit the function argument, the rate of matching events per second will be
        returned. Specifying 'rate' yields the same result. Finally, you can specify "count", to compute
        the number of matching events in each time period (as defined by the "buckets" option).
    --buckets=nnn
        The number of numeric values to return. The time range is divided into this many equal slices.
        For instance, suppose you query a four-hour period, with buckets = 4. The query will return four
        numbers, each covering a one-hour period. You may specify a value from 1 to 5000; 1 is the default.
    --output=csv|json|json-pretty
        How to display the results. 'csv' prints all values on a single line, separated by commas.
        'json' prints the raw JSON response from the server, as documented at
        https://www.scalyr.com/help/api#numericQuery. 'json-pretty' also prints the JSON response,
        but prettyprinted.
    --priority=high|low
        Specifies the execution priority for this query; defaults to "high". Use "low" for scripted
        operations where a delay of a second or so is acceptable. Rate limits are tighter for high-
        priority queries.
    --onlyUseSummaries=true|false
        Specifies whether to only query summaries, or to search the column store for any summaries not yet populated.
        Defaults to false.
    --createSummaries=true|false
        Specifies whether to create summaries for this query if they do not already exist. Defaults to true.
    --token=xxx
        Specify the API token. For this command, should be a "Read Logs" token.
    --version
        Prints the current version number of this tool.
    --verbose
        Writes detailed progress information to stderr.
    --proxy=<ip>:<port>
        An address to connect through when using a proxy. If not set will also take the value from one of the following
        environment variables if any are set: http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY




## Retrieving configuration files

The "get-file" command allows you to retrieve a configuration file, writing the file text to stdout.
Configuration files are used to define log parsers, dashboards, alerting rules, and more. Any page
on the Scalyr web site which contains a full-page text editor, is editing a configuration file.

Using the get-file command is simple:

    # Display the alerts file
    scalyr get-file /scalyr/alerts

    # Display the "Foo" dashboard
    scalyr get-file /scalyr/dashboards/Foo

Complete argument list:

    scalyr get-file file-path [options...]

    --version
        Prints the current version number of this tool.
    --token=xxx
        Specify the API token. For this command, should be a "Read Config" token.
    --verbose
        Writes detailed progress information to stderr.
    --proxy=<ip>:<port>
        An address to connect through when using a proxy. If not set will also take the value from one of the following
        environment variables if any are set: http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY


## Creating or updating configuration files

The "put-file" command allows you to create or overwrite a configuration file, taking the new
file content from stdin.

Using the put-file command is simple:

    # Overwrite the alerts file
    scalyr put-file /scalyr/alerts < alerts.json

    # Create or overwrite the "Foo" dashboard
    scalyr put-file /scalyr/dashboards/Foo < fooDashboard.json

Complete argument list:

    scalyr put-file file-path [options...]

    --version
        Prints the current version number of this tool.
    --token=xxx
        Specify the API token. For this command, should be a "Write Config" token.
    --verbose
        Writes detailed progress information to stderr.
    --proxy=<ip>:<port>
        An address to connect through when using a proxy. If not set will also take the value from one of the following
        environment variables if any are set: http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY

## Deleting configuration files

The "delete-file" command allows you to delete a configuration file:

Using the delete-file command is simple:

    # Delete the "Foo" dashboard
    scalyr delete-file /scalyr/dashboards/Foo

## Listing configuration files

The "list-files" command lists all configuration files:

    scalyr list-files

Complete argument list:

    scalyr list-files [options...]

    --version
        Prints the current version number of this tool.
    --token=xxx
        Specify the API token. For this command, should be a "Read Config" token.
    --verbose
        Writes detailed progress information to stderr.
    --proxy=<ip>:<port>
        An address to connect through when using a proxy. If not set will also take the value from one of the following
        environment variables if any are set: http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY


## TODO

Add option to use LF, rather than CRLF, when outputting CSV (for `facet-query` in particular).


## Revision History

#### Feb. 21, 2014: version 0.1

Initial release.
